Rebuild the FCC Weather App
	Why? I need to get back to coding applications again. I'm a little rusty and I miss it.
	Also, My current Weather App is not functional on CodePen. I need to use a different API source.

HTML ---> Design Ideas
	-Like the user is looking through a window?
	-Background changes depending on weather
	-Have Weather news updates?
	-Forcast
	-This day in Weather History
JS
	-React?
	-jQuery
	-
